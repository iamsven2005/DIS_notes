# Introduction to Computing

**Module Code**: CSC1001

This module is intended to be at an introductory level to provide an overview of the different modules taught in the computing science programme. The purpose is to enable students to appreciate the relevance and interrelationships of different modules without being lost in the details, as well as to instill a computing science mindset in them. Specifically, this module covers wide variety of topics ranging from binary number systems, the building blocks of hardware, the building blocks of software, to algorithms, database and security.

# Programming Fundamentals

**Module Code**: ICT1002

Programming is one of the most basic and essential skills for any professional in the field of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).

This module is intended for students with no prior computing knowledge or experience beyond basic familiarity with the operation of a personal computer and can be taken by any student interested in acquiring basic programming skills. In the context of the ICT programmes, the module is intended to be taken by students in their first term.

The foundations provided in this module are essential in most modules of the following terms in the ICT programmes. The topics covered in this module include Introduction to the historical and social context of computing, Basic concepts in programming (Data types, Control structures, Functions, Arrays, pointers, Files), Running, Testing and Debugging scripts and programs, Overview of Programming paradigms.

Programming concepts are demonstrated in a variety of languages and practised in a scripting language (Python) as well as a standard programming language (C).

# Computer Organisation and Architecture

**Module Code**: ICT1003

This is a foundation module whose main focus is on the characteristics and development of relatively high level ‘building’ blocks of a computer system. The highest level learning objective is to make clear how a computer program written in text is actually ‘executed’ by a computer, regardless of it being a mainframe, desktop or embedded system. A myriad of basic lower-level topics include explaining how a central processor operates, the characteristics of different memory subsystems, data representations and measurements of system performance will be covered. To ensure in-depth coverage of the topics, students will be exposed to assembly language programming and may be given the opportunity to experiment with a micro-controller based system during the course of the module. This module will also introduce some higher-level languages (such as C) that serve as a precursor for the "Embedded Systems Programming" module

# Web Systems and Technologies

**Module Code**: ICT1004

IT applications are increasingly web-based. This module covers the essential web technologies to equip students with the useful skills to build websites for web-based IT applications.

To begin, an overview of the web architecture will be presented to clarify the myriad and rapidly evolving web technologies. Next, the popular web technologies will be covered in details.

Specifically, the topics include HTML, CSS, JavaScript for client-side scripting, PHP for server-side scripting, MySQL database system and industry best practices to secure the websites.
